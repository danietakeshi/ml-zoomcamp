# Building a Car Price Prediction Model: Hands-On Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to session two of Machine Learning Zoom Camp! In this session, we will dive into an exciting hands-on project â€“ building a car price prediction model. Imagine a scenario where a user wants to sell a car through an online classified website but is unsure about the ideal selling price. Our goal is to develop a model that assists users in determining the best price for their vehicles. We'll walk you through the process of creating this model step by step.

## Data Source

To get started, we need a dataset containing information about various car features and their corresponding prices. For this project, we will utilize a dataset from Kaggle, a platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/your-link-goes-here). This dataset includes details such as the car's make, model, year, engine type, fuel type, and, most importantly, its price.

Let's take a quick look at what the data looks like:

- Manufacturer
- Model
- Year
- Engine Type
- Fuel Type
- MSRP (Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price)

The "MSRP" column represents the price of the car, which is the target variable we want to predict.

## Project Plan

Here's our plan for this car price prediction project:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Our first step is to explore the dataset. We'll examine the data's characteristics and gain insights into its structure and distribution.

2. **Data Preparation:** After getting familiar with the dataset, we'll prepare it for modeling. This includes cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

3. **Model Training:** We will train a linear regression model using the prepared dataset. Linear regression is a simple yet effective algorithm for predicting numerical values like car prices.

4. **Implementation of Linear Regression:** We won't stop at just using a pre-built library for linear regression. We will implement the linear regression algorithm ourselves to understand its inner workings.

5. **Model Evaluation:** To assess the quality of our model, we will use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. RMSE measures the difference between predicted and actual values and helps us evaluate how well our model performs.

6. **Feature Engineering:** We will explore feature engineering techniques to enhance the model's predictive power. Creating new features or transforming existing ones can significantly impact model performance.

7. **Handling Numerical Stability Issues:** During our modeling journey, we may encounter numerical stability problems. We will discuss regularization techniques to address these issues and ensure a robust model.

8. **Utilizing the Model:** Finally, we will demonstrate how to use the trained model to predict car prices accurately.

## Accessing the Code

All the code necessary for this session is available in the GitHub repository associated with the course. You can find it in the "Machine Learning Zoom Camp" repository under the "Chapter 2 - Car Price" directory. There are two main files:

1. **Notebook:** This file contains all the code and explanations you need for this session. It's a valuable resource for following along and practicing the concepts.

2. **CSV Data File:** This CSV file is the dataset we will use for training our car price prediction model.

## Next Steps

In our upcoming sessions, we will delve into each stage of this project in more detail. Stay tuned for hands-on coding and practical insights into building a robust car price prediction model. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this project will provide valuable experience in machine learning.

Now, let's get started with exploring and preparing our car price dataset!
