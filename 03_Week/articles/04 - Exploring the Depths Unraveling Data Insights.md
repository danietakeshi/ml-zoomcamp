**Title:** Exploring the Depths: Unraveling Data Insights - Lesson Four

**Introduction:**
Welcome to Lesson Four of the ZoomCamp session on machine learning! In this class, we're diving headfirst into exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA is a critical step in understanding your dataset before building machine learning models. Today, we'll be working with our full train dataset, which we meticulously prepared earlier.

**Preparing the Dataset:**
Before we begin exploring, let's ensure our dataset is ready. We still have the old indices that need resetting, so we'll quickly take care of that.

```python
# Resetting the indices
full_train.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
```

**Checking for Missing Values:**
The first step in EDA is checking for missing values. Fortunately, in our dataset, we've already addressed the missing values during the data preparation phase. Let's confirm that we're good to go.

```python
# Checking for missing values
missing_values = full_train.isnull().sum().sum()
print(f"Total missing values: {missing_values}")
```

**Understanding the Target Variable:**
Now, let's take a closer look at our target variable, which is "churn." Understanding its distribution is crucial.

```python
# Exploring the target variable "churn"
churn_distribution = full_train['churn'].value_counts(normalize=True)
print(churn_distribution)
```

We can see that approximately 27% of our users are churning, indicating a churn rate of 27%.

**Categorical and Numerical Variables:**
Our dataset contains a mix of categorical and numerical variables. Let's identify which variables fall into each category.

```python
# Categorizing variables
numerical = ['tenure', 'monthly_charges', 'total_charges']
categorical = [col for col in full_train.columns if col not in numerical + ['customer_id', 'churn']]
```

**Unique Values in Categorical Variables:**
Next, let's explore the categorical variables by checking the number of unique values in each.

```python
# Checking the number of unique values in categorical variables
unique_values = full_train[categorical].nunique()
print(unique_values)
```

This helps us understand the cardinality of each categorical variable.

**What's Next?**
In our next lesson, we'll continue our exploratory data analysis journey. We'll dive deeper into important categorical features, investigate churn rates for each variable, and calculate risk ratios. These insights will guide us in feature selection and model building.

Stay tuned for more exciting discoveries in the world of machine learning!
