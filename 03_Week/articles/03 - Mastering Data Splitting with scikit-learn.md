**Title**: Mastering Data Splitting with scikit-learn: A Guide

**Introduction:**
Welcome to Lesson Three of your machine learning journey. In this session, we'll delve into setting up the validation framework, a crucial step in the world of machine learning. Data splitting is like the foundation of your machine learning model, and here, we'll learn to do it efficiently using the scikit-learn library.

**Understanding Data Splitting:**
In previous lessons, you might have seen this image countless times: the entire dataset that we want to split into three parts—train, validation, and test. Our goal is to ensure our model is trained, validated, and tested on different sets of data to evaluate its performance accurately.

**Data Splitting with scikit-learn:**
So, how do we perform this data split efficiently using scikit-learn? Scikit-learn is a powerful Python library that not only offers popular machine learning algorithms but also provides useful utilities to simplify our tasks.

One such utility is the `train_test_split` function, which we'll use here. To get started, ensure that you have scikit-learn installed on your system.

**Splitting the Data:**
We typically aim for a 60-20-20 distribution for training, validation, and testing, respectively. To achieve this using scikit-learn, we set the `test_size` parameter to 0.2 (20%). Additionally, we fix the random seed to ensure reproducibility.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing)
full_train, data_frame_test = train_test_split(data_frame, test_size=0.2, random_state=1)
```

**Further Splitting:**
However, we're not done yet. To create the final three datasets—train, validation, and test—we need to split `full_train` once more.

Here's where it gets a bit tricky. We want 20% of the original dataset for validation, which means we need 25% of `full_train`. We achieve this by setting `test_size` to 0.2 (20%) for `full_train`.

```python
# Splitting full_train into train and validation (75% train, 25% validation)
data_frame_train, data_frame_validation = train_test_split(full_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=1)
```

**Preparation of Target Variables:**
Before we wrap up, it's essential to prepare our target variables (Y) for each dataset.

```python
# Preparing target variables
Y_train = data_frame_train['_numbery']
Y_validation = data_frame_validation['_numbery']
Y_test = data_frame_test['_numbery']

# Removing target variable from data frames
data_frame_train.drop(columns=['_numbery'], inplace=True)
data_frame_validation.drop(columns=['_numbery'], inplace=True)
data_frame_test.drop(columns=['_numbery'], inplace=True)
```

**Conclusion:**
With these steps, you've successfully set up a robust validation framework for your machine learning project using scikit-learn. In our next lesson, we'll dive into exploratory data analysis, where we'll explore missing values, delve into the target variable, and much more.
