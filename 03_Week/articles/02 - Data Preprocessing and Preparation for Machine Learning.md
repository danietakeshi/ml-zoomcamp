Title: Data Preprocessing and Preparation for Machine Learning: Lesson 2

Introduction:
Welcome back to Lesson 2! In this session, we will dive deeper into the data we're working with, download it, and perform essential preprocessing tasks to prepare it for machine learning analysis. We'll be using Python and Pandas for these tasks.

1. Data Download:
First, let's ensure we have the data we need. If you're following along with us, make sure to download the dataset. For this example, we'll use the "WGIR" utility, but you can also use your preferred method.

```python
!wget [data_url] -O data_week_three.csv
```

2. Data Inspection:
Now that we have the dataset, let's load it into a Pandas DataFrame. We'll use the `pandas.read_csv` function for this purpose, assuming the data file is named "data_week_three.csv."

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset into a DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('data_week_three.csv')

# Inspect the first few rows of the dataset
data.head()
```

Upon inspection, you'll notice that we have a dataset with 21 columns, each representing different variables related to customers. One of the most crucial variables is "Churn," which indicates whether a customer has churned (yes or no), a vital target variable for our machine learning analysis.

3. Data Cleanup:
Before proceeding, let's ensure our dataset is consistent. We want to make sure all column names are in lowercase and replace spaces with underscores for uniformity.

```python
# Clean column names
data.columns = data.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')
```

4. Handling Missing Values:
Next, let's address missing values. In our dataset, "Total Charges" contains non-numeric values represented by spaces. We'll convert these spaces to NaN (Not a Number) to handle them effectively.

```python
# Convert non-numeric values to NaN in the 'Total Charges' column
data['total_charges'] = pd.to_numeric(data['total_charges'], errors='coerce')

# Fill missing values with zeros
data['total_charges'].fillna(0, inplace=True)
```

5. Encoding Categorical Variables:
Lastly, for machine learning purposes, we need to encode categorical variables. Our "Churn" variable contains "yes" and "no" values. We'll map these to binary values, where 1 represents churn ("yes") and 0 represents no churn ("no").

```python
# Map 'yes' to 1 and 'no' to 0 in the 'churn' column
data['churn'] = data['churn'].map({'Yes': 1, 'No': 0})
```

Conclusion:
In this lesson, we've successfully performed essential data preprocessing tasks to ensure our dataset is ready for machine learning analysis. We've downloaded the data, cleaned up column names, handled missing values, and encoded our target variable "Churn" into binary values. In the next lesson, we'll focus on setting up a validation framework and splitting our dataset for further analysis.
