Title: Machine Learning for Customer Churn Prediction: A Comprehensive Guide

Introduction

Welcome back to week three of the Machine Learning Zoom Camp! In this week's session, we will delve into the exciting world of machine learning for classification. Our focus will be on a practical project: customer churn prediction. Imagine working for a telecom company with a large customer base. Some customers may be considering leaving your services for better alternatives, and our goal is to identify these potential churners and take proactive measures to retain them.

Understanding Customer Churn

Churn refers to the act of customers discontinuing their use of a service or leaving a company. In our context, it means customers who are considering switching to another telecom provider or ceasing to use our services altogether. To prevent this, we aim to assign a likelihood score between 0 and 1 to each customer, indicating their probability of churning. For instance, a score of 20% suggests a low likelihood of churn, while 85% indicates a high likelihood.

Our strategy is to target customers with higher churn probabilities by sending them promotional offers such as discounts. However, precision is crucial because we don't want to offer discounts to customers who are unlikely to churn. At the same time, we don't want to miss potential churners. To tackle this, we'll employ machine learning classification techniques.

Classification in Machine Learning

Classification is a type of supervised machine learning where we categorize data into predefined classes. In this scenario, we are dealing with binary classification, where the target variable (Y) can take two values: 0 or 1. A Y value of 1 represents a positive example (a customer who churned), while 0 denotes a negative example (a customer who didn't churn).

Our goal is to build a model that can predict whether a customer will churn based on various features (X) such as demographic information, contract details, and usage patterns.

Getting Started with the Dataset

To train our churn prediction model, we'll use a dataset from Kaggle called "Telco Customer Churn." This dataset contains information about telecom customers, including their gender, contract details, and, most importantly, whether they churned or not.

The Steps Ahead

Here's an overview of the steps we'll take in this project:

1. Data Preparation: We'll download and prepare the dataset for analysis and model building.

2. Validation Framework: Instead of manually implementing it, we'll use iKid Learner to set up our validation framework.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: We'll explore the data, paying special attention to the target variable (churn), and look at feature importance characteristics.

4. Feature Importance Metrics: We'll discuss various feature importance metrics, such as mutual information and correlation.

5. Encoding Categorical Variables: To handle categorical data, we'll use iKid Learner for encoding.

6. Logistic Regression: We'll introduce logistic regression as a classification model and compare it with linear regression.

7. Model Evaluation: We'll assess the performance of our model and interpret its coefficients.

Conclusion

In this article, we've outlined our plan for predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. By the end of this project, you'll have a better understanding of classification problems, feature importance, and how to interpret and use logistic regression models for customer churn prediction.

In the next lesson, we will dive into data download and preparation. Stay tuned to embark on this exciting journey of customer churn prediction with us!
