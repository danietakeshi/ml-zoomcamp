# Building a Machine Learning Web Service with Flask - Week 5

Welcome back to Week 5 of the Machine Learning Zoomcamp! In this week's session, we delve into serving the churn model with Flask. We'll cover some key concepts and practical steps to turn your machine learning model into a web service. Our goal is to create a web service that provides churn predictions based on customer data.

## Lesson Highlights

Before we dive into the details, let's set some ground rules for this post:

1. This is Week 5 of the Machine Learning Zoomcamp.
2. Our audience is assumed to be technically proficient.
3. We'll focus on the most useful topics from this lesson.

With that out of the way, let's proceed to explore the key takeaways from this session.

## Understanding the Objective

In this lesson, our objective is to convert our churn prediction model into a web service using Flask. We've previously created a script for training the model and saved it to a pickle file. Additionally, we've learned about Flask and created a basic web service with it. Now, it's time to integrate our predictive model into this web service.

## Building the Churn Service

We'll start by creating a Flask-based web service named "churn service." This service will host our churn prediction model and provide predictions via a `/predict` route.

### The Request

Marketing services will send customer information to our web service. This data will be in JSON format and include all the relevant customer details.

```json
{
    "customer_id": "xyz123",
    "total_charges": 24.0,
    "monthly_tenure": 10,
    // Other customer features
}
```

### Implementing the Prediction Logic

Now, let's implement the prediction logic. We create a `predict` function that accepts customer data as input and returns churn predictions. In this function, we use our trained model to make predictions.

```python
def predict(customer):
    # Load the trained model
    model = load_model()
    
    # Preprocess the customer data and make predictions
    prediction = model.predict(customer)
    
    # Determine if the customer is likely to churn
    is_churning = (prediction > 0.5)
    
    return {
        "churn_probability": prediction.tolist(),
        "is_churning": is_churning
    }
```

### Setting Up the Flask App

To set up our Flask app for the churn service, we import Flask and create an instance of the app.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict_churn():
    customer_data = request.get_json()
    result = predict(customer_data)
    return jsonify(result)
```

In this code, we define a route `/predict` that accepts POST requests with customer data in JSON format. We use the `predict` function to generate predictions and return them as JSON.

### Handling JSON Data

Flask provides a `request` object for handling incoming data. We use `request.get_json()` to extract the JSON data sent in the request body.

## Preparing the Response

We structure our response in JSON format, including the churn probability and whether the customer is likely to churn. This information can be utilized by marketing services to determine whether to send promotional emails.

```json
{
    "churn_probability": [0.78],
    "is_churning": true
}
```

## Running the Flask App

To run the Flask app, we use the `flask run` command. However, for production deployment, it's recommended to use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn. We'll demonstrate how to do this with Gunicorn.

First, install Gunicorn using `pip`:

```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

Next, create a Gunicorn command to run your Flask app:

```bash
gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:9696 predict:app
```

In this command:
- `-b` specifies the binding address and port.
- `predict:app` tells Gunicorn to use the `app` object from the `predict.py` file.

## Windows Considerations

If you're using Windows, Gunicorn may not be suitable. Alternatively, you can use Waitress, a WSGI server that works on Windows.

First, install Waitress:

```bash
pip install waitress
```

Then, create a Waitress command to run your Flask app:

```bash
waitress-serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9696 predict:app
```

This command is similar to the Gunicorn command, but it uses Waitress instead.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've transformed our churn prediction script into a Flask web service. We've covered how to handle JSON data, make predictions, and structure the response. Additionally, we've demonstrated running the app using both Gunicorn and Waitress, catering to different deployment environments.

In the upcoming lesson, we'll delve into dependency and environment management, essential when working on projects with varying library versions. Stay tuned for more exciting content!
