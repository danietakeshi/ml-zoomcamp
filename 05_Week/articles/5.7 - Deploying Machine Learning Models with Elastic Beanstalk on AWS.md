# Deploying Machine Learning Models with Elastic Beanstalk on AWS

Welcome back to week 5 of the Machine Learning Zoomcamp! In this lesson, we will delve into the deployment of our Docker container to the cloud using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. If you're a technical enthusiast eager to learn about essential deployment topics, you're in the right place!

## Why AWS Elastic Beanstalk?

In our previous lesson, we successfully built a Docker image and containerized our churn prediction service, gaining proficiency in running it locally. Now, we're ready to take our model and service to the cloud, and we've chosen AWS Elastic Beanstalk for this purpose.

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is one of the most widely used cloud providers globally, and Elastic Beanstalk offers a straightforward way to deploy applications, including Docker containers. While this lesson focuses on AWS and Elastic Beanstalk, there are various cloud providers to explore, such as Heroku, Google Cloud, Azure, and PythonAnywhere. These platforms provide similar services, so feel free to explore your options.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have an AWS account set up and configured. If you don't have an AWS account yet, you can follow the instructions provided in [this article](https://machinelearningbook.com/articles/create-aws-account) on the Machine Learning Book's website to create one.

## Deploying with Elastic Beanstalk

Now, let's dive into the deployment process with Elastic Beanstalk. We'll go step by step through the necessary actions.

### 1. Installing AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI

To interact with Elastic Beanstalk, we need the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (CLI). However, instead of installing it system-wide, we'll install it only for our project. We can achieve this by using pipenv, a virtual environment manager.

```bash
pipenv install awsebcli --dev
```

This command installs the AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI as a development dependency within your project's virtual environment.

### 2. Initializing Elastic Beanstalk

Next, we initialize Elastic Beanstalk for our project, specifying the Docker platform and other relevant information.

```bash
pipenv shell
eb init -p docker
```

This command prompts you to select your AWS region, so choose the one that's most suitable for your location.

### 3. Testing Locally

Before deploying to the cloud, you can test your application locally using Elastic Beanstalk's local runner.

```bash
eb local run
```

This command builds and runs your Docker image locally. You can then test your service using the provided URL. Remember that this setup is open to the world, so take care to secure your service as needed.

### 4. Creating the Elastic Beanstalk Environment

Now, let's create the Elastic Beanstalk environment to host our Docker container.

```bash
eb create churn-serving
```

This command creates an environment named "churn-serving" and sets up the necessary infrastructure for your Docker container. Elastic Beanstalk handles load balancing and auto-scaling configurations automatically.

### 5. Accessing Your Deployed Service

After the environment creation, Elastic Beanstalk provides you with a URL where your service is deployed. You can access it directly and start using your churn prediction service in the cloud.

### 6. Be Mindful of Security

Keep in mind that by default, your service is open to the world. To secure it, configure your Elastic Beanstalk environment to allow only specific access, such as your local machine or other trusted services.

### 7. Terminate the Environment

Once you've finished testing or using your deployed service, remember to terminate the Elastic Beanstalk environment to avoid unnecessary charges.

```bash
eb terminate
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've explored deploying machine learning models with AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It offers a convenient and scalable solution to host your Dockerized applications in the cloud. While we've focused on AWS in this tutorial, the concepts are transferrable to other cloud providers. So, whether you choose AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud, or another platform, you're well-equipped to deploy your machine learning models and services to the cloud.

Happy deploying! ðŸš€
